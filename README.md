# Island Optimized

Island Optimized is a modpack designed for playing on the [MCC Island](https://mccisland.net) server.
It is initially based on an [optimized client mod list by the Aeltumn of the Noxcrew](https://mccisland.net/threads/guide-optimized-client-for-playing-on-mcci.2943/).

There are three flavors of the pack:

## Lite

This flavor is as true to the original mod list as possible. It is as optimized as possible, with minimal aesthetic modifications.
